# Konekt Future - Phase 2+ Vision

> **Beyond MVP: Where Konekt could go next**

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

This document is a **living brain dump** of ideas, features, and expansion possibilities for Konekt after MVP launch. Not all of these will happen, and priorities will shift based on user feedback and market needs.

**Principle:** Ship MVP first. Learn from real users. Then build what matters.

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Post-MVP Enhancements

**Timeline:** 3-6 months after MVP launch

### Enhanced Organizer Tools:

#### 1. **Event Templates**
- Save event configs as templates
- "Duplicate Last Event" button
- Pre-configured program structures for common event types
- Share templates with other organizers (community library)

**Why:** Recurring events (monthly meetups) need faster setup.

#### 2. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
- Registration funnel metrics (invite sent → registered → checked in)
- Engagement heatmaps (which sessions got most attention)
- Attendee demographics breakdown
- Drop-off analysis
- Export detailed reports (PDF/Excel)

**Why:** Data-driven organizers want insights to improve future events.

#### 3. **Team Collaboration**
- Multiple organizers per event
- Role-based permissions (admin, editor, viewer)
- Activity log (who changed what when)
- Comments/notes on participants

**Why:** Larger events have multiple people managing logistics.

#### 4. **Email Automation**
- Pre-event reminders (1 week before, 1 day before)
- Post-event thank you emails
- Custom email templates with branding
- Drip campaigns for registered attendees

**Why:** Manual email coordination is tedious for 50+ people.

#### 5. **Integrations**
- **Zapier/Make** - Connect to existing workflows
- **Google Calendar** - Auto-sync event dates
- **Mailchimp** - Export attendee lists
- **Slack/Discord** - Post-event community channels
- **Notion** - Sync participant data

**Why:** Organizers already use other tools - make Konekt the hub.

#### 6. **Ticketing & Payments** (Optional)
- Paid event support
- Stripe integration for ticket sales
- Multiple ticket tiers (Early Bird, VIP, Standard)
- Discount codes
- Revenue dashboard for organizers

**Why:** Some events charge attendance fees - capture that revenue stream (commission-based).

**Consideration:** Adds complexity. Only build if demand is clear from organizers.

---

### Enhanced Attendee Experience:

#### 1. **My Events Dashboard**
- Timeline view of upcoming/past events
- Calendar integration (add all events at once)
- Event reminders/notifications
- Favorites (bookmark events I'm interested in)

**Why:** Power users attend multiple events - need better organization.

#### 2. **Advanced Networking Features**
- **Smart Suggestions** - "People you should meet" based on:
  - Similar companies/industries
  - Complementary roles (founders ↔ investors)
  - Shared interests/tags
  - Past event attendance overlap
- **Networking Goals** - Set "I want to meet X people from Y industry"
- **Connection Requests** - Send intro request via LinkedIn
- **Meeting Scheduler** - Book 15-min slots during event

**Why:** Proactive networking beats random encounters.

#### 3. **Personalized Event Recommendations**
- Based on past attendance
- Based on profile (role, company, interests)
- Based on connections (who else is going)
- Email digest: "Events you might like this month"

**Why:** Discovery problem - people miss relevant events.

#### 4. **Post-Event Follow-up**
- Export connections made (list of people I talked to)
- "Thank you" messages to organizer
- Rate event + provide feedback
- Share event photos/notes

**Why:** Networking value extends beyond event day.

## 🧠 Phase 3: Cybernetics-Powered Features

**Timeline:** 6-12 months after launch

Leveraging founder's cybernetics background to add intelligent, systems-thinking features.

### 1. **Event Health Score**
Real-time system health monitoring for events.

**Inputs:**
- Registration rate vs. time to event
- Check-in rate vs. expected attendance
- Participant diversity metrics
- Engagement signals (app opens, profile views)

**Outputs:**
- Green/Yellow/Red status indicator
- Predictive alerts: "Low check-in rate, send reminder?"
- Recommendations: "Invite more people from X industry for balance"

**Why:** Organizers want early warning if event is underperforming.

### 2. **Smart Networking Suggestions (AI-powered)**
Machine learning model to optimize networking matches.

**Algorithm considers:**
- Complementary goals (founders seeking advisors)
- Industry overlaps and gaps
- Seniority balance (juniors + seniors)
- Past successful connections (learning from feedback)
- Conversation starters based on shared interests

**Delivery:**
- Push notification: "You should meet Sarah (Series A founder)"
- In-app "People Near You" feature during event
- Post-event: "Here's who you missed meeting"

**Why:** Most networking is random - we can optimize it.

### 3. **Event Flow Optimization**
Feedback loops for continuous improvement.

**Features:**
- Session attendance tracking (which talks were popular)
- Real-time crowding alerts (room X is full, go to Y)
- Bottleneck detection (check-in taking too long)
- Post-event analytics: "Session X had 90% attendance, do more like this"

**Why:** Events are complex systems - optimize them like factories.

### 4. **Ecosystem Mapping**
Visualize the startup/business ecosystem through event data.

**Concepts:**
- Network graphs: Who knows who across events
- Company clusters: Which startups attend same events
- Influence scores: Key connectors in ecosystem
- Trend detection: Emerging topics/industries

**Use cases:**
- Investors: Find deal flow via event attendance patterns
- Founders: Identify strategic partners
- Event organizers: Understand their audience better

**Why:** Events generate valuable social graph data.

- "Early Bird" - Registered 1 week before event
- "Community Builder" - Attended 10 events

### Leaderboards:
- Most active networkers
- Most events attended
- Most connections made

**Why:** Some audiences respond well to gamification (younger crowds, tech events).

**Caution:** Can feel gimmicky for serious business events - make it optional.

## 🧪 Experimental Ideas (Maybe Someday)

### 1. **Konekt Score**
Personal networking effectiveness metric.

**Factors:**
- Events attended
- Connections made
- Follow-up rate (did you actually connect on LinkedIn?)
- Reciprocal connections (do people want to meet you?)

**Use case:** Gamification, but also signal to organizers ("invite high-Konekt-score people").

**Risk:** Could feel invasive or elitist. Tread carefully.

---

### 2. **Event Matchmaking**
Tinder-style interface for finding events.

**Swipe right:** Interested  
**Swipe left:** Not interested  
**Algorithm learns:** Preferences over time

**Why:** Discovery problem for attendees.

---

### 3. **Konekt Spaces**
Physical co-working space integration.

**Concept:**
- Partner with co-working spaces
- Konekt screens at entrances (show today's events)
- Konekt kiosks (quick check-in)
- Konekt-branded event lounges

**Why:** Physical presence strengthens brand.

---

### 4. **Event Dating**
Networking with a twist - help people find co-founders, advisors, investors.

**Difference from LinkedIn:** Event-specific matching during actual events.

**Risk:** Could feel too Silicon Valley. Test carefully in Czech market.

---

### 5. **Konekt Community Platform**
Full-fledged community platform around events.

**Features:**
- Discussion forums
- Job board
- Resource library
- Member directory

**Risk:** Scope creep. Stay focused on events.

---

## 🚨 What We Will NOT Build

Important to define boundaries:

❌ **Full social network** - We're not LinkedIn/Facebook  
❌ **Video conferencing platform** - We're not Zoom (but we integrate)  
❌ **Project management tool** - We're not Notion (but we integrate)  
❌ **CRM replacement** - We're not Salesforce (but we sync)  

**Why:** Focus. Do event management extremely well. Integrate with existing tools for ancillary needs.

**Note:** Ticketing/payments could be explored as revenue stream - not replacing Eventbrite entirely, but offering simple ticket sales for paid events.
