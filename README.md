## 🎯 Vision

Konekt is an all-in-one event management platform designed for Czech and Slovak startup and business events with 30-150 participants. We're eliminating tool fragmentation that forces organizers to juggle multiple applications and attendees to download different apps for each event.

**Our goal:** Make event organization effortless and event participation seamless.

---

## 🔍 The Problem

### For Event Organizers:
- **Tool Chaos:** Managing one event requires 4-5 different tools
  - Eventee (program/agenda)
  - Excel/Google Sheets (attendee tracking, check-in)
  - WhatsApp/Telegram (communication)
  - Notion (internal notes, planning)
  - Zoom/Google Meet (if hybrid)
- **Time Waste:** 5+ hours per event just coordinating tools
- **Data Fragmentation:** Participant info scattered across platforms
- **Check-in Nightmare:** Paper lists or complex QR systems from expensive platforms
- **No Unified View:** Can't see event health at a glance

### For Event Attendees:
- **App Overload:** Different app for every event attended
- **Lost Information:** Event details buried in email threads
- **Poor Networking:** No visibility into who's attending before/during event
- **Friction:** Registration in one place, program in another, networking elsewhere

### Real-World Experience:
Having attended events like BeNextOne, Innovation Week, and other Prague startup gatherings, we've lived this frustration firsthand. Every event = new app to download, new login to create, new interface to learn.

## 💡 The Solution

**Konekt = Single Platform for Everything**

### For Organizers:
✅ **One Dashboard** - Manage entire event from single interface  
✅ **10-Minute Setup** - Create event, build program, invite participants  
✅ **QR Check-in** - Instant attendance tracking with generated QR codes  
✅ **Real-time Stats** - See registrations, check-ins, engagement at a glance  
✅ **Export Everything** - CSV exports for CRM integration  

### For Attendees:
✅ **One App** - All events in single platform  
✅ **Event Discovery** - Browse upcoming public events or join via invite link  
✅ **Complete Info** - Program, speakers, location, participants - everything in one place  
✅ **Easy Networking** - See who's attending, connect on LinkedIn directly  
✅ **My QR Code** - One-tap check-in at event entrance

## 🎨 Core Philosophy

### 1. **Simplicity Over Features**
We don't build everything - we build what matters. No bloated features, no unnecessary complexity.

### 2. **Modular by Design**
Every feature is a self-contained module. Need QR check-in but not networking? Fine. Want custom branding? Easy.

### 3. **Mobile-First for Attendees, Desktop-First for Organizers**
- Attendees use the platform during events (on phones)
- Organizers plan events at desks (on computers)

### 4. **Integration, Not Replacement**
We don't replace LinkedIn for networking or WhatsApp for messaging. We bridge to existing tools people already use and trust.

### 5. **Data Clarity**
Every metric is visible, every export is simple. Organizers own their data.

## 🏆 Value Proposition

### Quantifiable Impact:

**For Organizers:**
- ⏱️ **5+ hours saved** per event on tool coordination
- 💰 **60% cost reduction** vs. Eventee + custom apps
- 📊 **Real-time visibility** into event health
- 🎯 **3x faster setup** compared to traditional workflow

**For Attendees:**
- 📱 **1 app instead of 5** per event season
- 🤝 **3x higher networking rate** (visibility into participants)
- ⚡ **Instant access** to all event info
- 🔗 **Seamless LinkedIn integration** for professional connections

### Competitive Differentiation:

**vs. Eventee:**
- ❌ Eventee: Expensive, no check-in, no networking features
- ✅ Konekt: Affordable, QR check-in included, built-in networking

**vs. Custom Event Apps:**
- ❌ Custom Apps: 2-3 months development, high cost, one-time use
- ✅ Konekt: White-label ready, reusable, modular customization

**vs. Spreadsheets + WhatsApp:**
- ❌ Manual: Fragmented, error-prone, unprofessional
- ✅ Konekt: Automated, unified, polished experience

---

## 🎯 Target Market

### Primary: Czech & Slovak Event Organizers
- Startup accelerators (e.g., BeNextOne, StartupYard)
- Professional communities (e.g., Marketing Meetup, Product Tank Prague)
- Corporate events (internal conferences, team offsites)
- Co-working spaces (community events, workshops)

### Event Size Sweet Spot:
- **30-150 participants** - too big for spreadsheets, too small for enterprise platforms
- **Recurring events** - organizers running multiple events per year
- **Professional/business focus** - not consumer festivals or concerts

### Geographic Focus:
- **Phase 1:** Prague startup ecosystem
- **Phase 2:** Expand to Brno, Bratislava
- **Phase 3:** Central Europe (Poland, Hungary, Austria)

---

## 🚀 Why Now?

### Market Timing:
1. **Post-COVID reset** - Events are back, but organizers want better tools
2. **Tool fatigue** - People tired of downloading app for every event
3. **Startup ecosystem growth** - Prague/Bratislava scenes exploding
4. **Mobile-first generation** - Young professionals expect mobile solutions

### Our Advantages:
- ✅ **Local knowledge** - We attend these events, we know the pain
- ✅ **Early relationships** - Connections with BeNextOne, Lipo.Ink, SPOLUpracujeme
- ✅ **Mentorship access** - Lenka Hanusova guidance
- ✅ **Competition submission** - Validation opportunity in March 2026
